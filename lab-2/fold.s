/// Combines the the elements a buffer into an accumulator by applying the given function on the
/// accumulator and each element, from right to left.
///
/// This function "folds" a sequence of elements from right to left into an accumulator using an
/// updating function provided by its caller. The updating function accepts the address of the
/// accumulator in `x0` and the address of an element in `x1`, combines the value at `x1` with the
/// value at `x0`, and writes the result in `x0`. The addresses of the `n`-th (with `n` less than
/// the number of elements in the buffer) is computed by offsetting the buffer's base address by
/// `n * s`, where `s` is the size of an element.
///
/// When the function returns, `x0` contains the address of the accumulator that was initially
/// passed in `x3`. The result of other argument registers is unspecified.
///
/// The following is a possible recursive implementation of `_foldright` in C:
///
///     void* foldright(void* xs, int s, int n, void* a, void(*f)(void*, void*)) {
///       if (n != 0) {
///         char* p = (char*)xs + s * --n;
///         f(a, p);
///         foldright(xs, s, n, a, f);
///       }
///       return a;
///     }
///
/// - Parameters:
///   - x0 The address of a buffer.
///   - x1 The size of each element in the buffer pointed to by `x0`, , which is less than 2^16
///   - x2 The number of elements in the buffer pointed to by `x0`, which is less than 2^48.
///   - x3 The address of the initial accumulator value.
///   - x4 The address of a function that combines an element with the accumulator.
///
